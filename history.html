                <p>On 15h of September 2021 two friends created the channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Slbh_Editz" target="_blank">Slbh_Editz</a>
               and uploded the first video on the very next day . <br> It was very slow at the beginning but after two to three months the first video hit 1k views.
            <br>Then comes the big invesment i bought a 200$ phone (16000rs) puerly for video editing , i started to put more effort and time to the videos 
        <br>again a disaster but this time its a more serious one . Corona has been eradicated from the world , which may be good fro some people but for me it meant that i was to go to school.
    <br>So i stopped uploading videos for one month. This is where my friend comes to action , after that 1 month period he uploded a video every day . And that si where a big miracle comes in 
<br> My friends uploads the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kLtNbW98Z90" target="_blank">Choose Your Career</a>. and after video he didnt upload for god knows how many days.
<br> It was a fine day , it was 9pm , we were playing football when my friend came and told me that our video got 750k views.We were so happy we gave a celebration fro a total of 10$(800rs).
<br> Then we uploaded constantly with some litte breaks here and there and now we have a total of 
<br> 29,600 subs , 646 videos , 12,697,565  views . All thanks to you guys!.</p>
